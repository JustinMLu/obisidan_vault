### Welcome to my Obsidian vault of notes

- Everything here lives as a Markdown file
- Shoutout to Eli from the infamous ***Carnegie Mellon University*** for showing me Obsidian
	- Eli if you're reading this, this is like Boostnote but 10x better because it won't randomly delete all my Cloud notes like it did in high school once
